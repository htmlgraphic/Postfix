## Postfix Docker

Postfix is a very nice mail courier service, enjoyed by many. This repo will give you a turn key, fully functional build of a Docker container for use in production or your dev environment.

---

## Quick Start
```bash
	> git clone https://github.com/htmlgraphic/Postfix.git && cd Postfix
	> cp .env.example .env
	> make
	> make build
```

### Repo Breakdown

##### Test Driven Development

**CircleCI** - Test the Dockerfile process, can the container be built the correctly? Verify the build process with a number of tests. Currently with this service no code can be tested on the running container. Data can be echo and available grepping the output via `docker logs | grep value`

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/htmlgraphic/Postfix/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=b99a13800c40caa2cc8bafa36258acccf038b8aa)](https://circleci.com/gh/htmlgraphic/Postfix/tree/master)


**Shippable** - Run tests on the actual built container. These tests ensure the scripts have been setup properly and the service can start with parameters defined. If any test(s) fail the system should be reviewed closer.

* To use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/htmlgraphic/Docker) review the `circle.yml` file.
* To use [Shippable](http://shippable.com) review the `shippable.yml` file. This service will use a `circle.yml` file configuration but for the unique features provided by **Shippable** it is best to use the deadicated `shippable.yml` file. This service will fully test the creation of your container and can push the complete image to your private Docker repo if you desire.
